# MUSA-Practicum-Philly-Loading-Zone

In October 2022, the City of Philadelphia introduced a pilot program that tested 20 paid, curbside loading spaces for delivery drivers in Center City, known as “smart loading zones.” Delivery companies were able to reserve spaces and times through a smartphone app. In addtion to this, our new application will serve as a back-end tool that will allow planners to predict demand for curbside loading spaces at any specific location.
